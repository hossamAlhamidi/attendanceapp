# Attend Me

One of the main challenges for instructors in the field of education is to take students' attendance in a reasonable time. The challenge arises even more if the number of students increases in the classroom, so if we say an instructor would take 5-10min to attend 20-30 students, imagine the time needed for making attendance for 80-100 students.

This project's priority is to develop an automated attendance system. The AAS (automated attendance system) focuses on decreasing the time to make the attendance and making it easier for the instructors by not needing to go through the list of students every day for every class/section.
